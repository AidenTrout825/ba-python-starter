==== Personalized Python Profile Card
This is a simple, single-file Python project designed specifically for high school students learning about Source Control (Git) and collaboration using GitHub.

The goal of this project is to take a base file, customize it with your own information, and commit your changes to your own repository.

You will be using online GitHub, GitHub Desktop, and Thonny in this activity

==== The Assignment: Your First Git Workflow
Your task is to follow the industry-standard workflow to make this code your own.

Step 1: Get the Code (Fork & Clone)
Clone the repository to your local computer using the Git command line:

Step 2: Make it Yours (The Code Change)
Open the file profile.py.

Locate the PROFILE_DATA dictionary at the top of the file.

Replace ALL the placeholder data with your own information (Name, favorite project, learning goals, etc.).

Step 3: Save the History (Commit)
Once your data is updated, tell Git to save this new snapshot of the file:

Stage your changes (tell Git which files you want to include in the snapshot):

Commit the staged changes (create the snapshot with a descriptive message):

Step 4: Share Your Work (Push)
Finally, send your local, committed changes up to your remote repository on GitHub:

Congratulations! You have successfully completed your first Git workflow: Clone -> Edit -> Add -> Commit -> Push.
